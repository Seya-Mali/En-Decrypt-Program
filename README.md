# En-Decrypt-Program
This program uses AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), a symmetric algorithm by NIST, to encrypt and decrypt files. AES works on fixed-size data blocks with a single key, processing each block separately. Larger key sizes provide stronger encryption, ensuring secure data handling, as implemented in this program.
